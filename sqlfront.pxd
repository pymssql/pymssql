    # Add a parameter to a remote procedure call.
    #
    #   Parameters:
    #     dbproc    contains all information needed by db-lib to manage
    #               communications with the server.
    #     paramname literal name of the parameter, according to the stored
    #               procedure (starts with '@'). Optional. If not used,
    #               parameters will be passed in order instead of by name.
    #     status    must be DBRPCRETURN, if this parameter is a return
    #               parameter, else 0.
    #     type      datatype of the value parameter e.g. SYBINT4, SYBCHAR
    #     maxlen    Maximum output size of the parameter's value to be returned
    #               by the stored procedure, usually the size of your host
    #               variable. Fixed-length datatypes take -1 (NULL or not).
    #               Non-OUTPUT parameters also use -1. Use 0 to send a NULL
    #               value for a variable length datatype.
    #     datalen   For variable-length datatypes, the byte size of the data
    #               to be sent, exclusive of any null terminator. For
    #               fixed-length datatypes use -1. To send a NULL value, use 0.
    #     value     Address of your host variable.
    #
    #   Return values:
    #     SUCCEED   normal
    #     FAIL      on error
