Change Log
==========

Version 2.2.0 - To be released
==============================

General
-------

- Stop using 7.1 as default value for the TDS protocol version used in connections.

  This is a backward incompatible change and affects connections using both
  `pymssql` and `_mssql`.

  Now you need to specify a TDS protocol version explicitly by using any of
  the supported mechanisms (in descending order of precedence):

  * Using the ``tds_version`` paramenter of ``pymssql.connect()`` and
    ``_mssql.connect()``
  * A ``TDSVER`` enviromnent variable (see FreeTDS documentation)
  * A ``freetds.conf`` file (see FreeTDS documentation)

- Drop support for versions of FreeTDS older than 0.91.
- Accept 7.3 as TDS protocol version when establishing a connection.

Features
--------

- Support for new in SQL Server 2008 ``DATE``, ``TIME`` and ``DATETIME2`` data
  types (GH-156). The following conditions need to be additionally met so
  values of these column types can be returned from the database as their
  native corresponding Python data types instead of as strings:

  * Underlying FreeTDS must be 0.95 or newer.
  * TDS protocol version in use must be 7.3 or newer.

  Thanks Ed Avis for the implementation. (GH-331)

Bug fixes
---------

- Fix ``tds_version``  ``_mssql`` connection property value for TDS version.
  7.1 is actually 7.1 and not 8.0.

Version 2.1.3 - 2016-06-22 - Ramiro Morales
===========================================

- Windows official binaries: Rollback changes to Windows binaries we had
  implemented in pymssql 2.1.2; go back to using:

  * A statically linked version of FreeTDS (v0.95.95)
  * No SSL support

- Update bundled Linux static version of FreeTDS to v0.95.95.

Features
--------

- We now publish Linux PEP 513 manylinux wheels on PyPI.

Bug fixes
---------

- Add support for reporting TDS version 7.3 is in use via the ``tds_version``
  property of a ``_mssql``-level connection.

Version 2.1.2 - 2016-02-10 - Ramiro Morales
===========================================

.. attention:: Windows users: You need to download and install additional DLLs

    pymssql version 2.1.2 includes a change in the official Windows binaries:
    FreeTDS isn't statically linked as it happened up to release 2.1.1, as that
    FreeTDS copy lacked SSL support.

    Please see http://pymssql.org/en/latest/freetds.html#windows for futher
    details.

    We are trying to find a balance between security and convenience and will
    be evaluating the situation for future releases. Your feedback is greatly
    welcome.

General
-------

- Drop support for Python 2.6.

- Add support for Python 3.5.

- Update shipped Linux FreeTDS static libs to 0.95

Features
--------

- Add ability to set TDS protocol version from pymssql when connecting to SQL
  Server. For the remaining pymssql 2.1.x releases its default value will be 7.1
  (GH-323)

- Add Dockerfile and a Docker image and instructions on how to use it (GH-258).
  This could be a convenient way to use pymssql without having to build stuff.
  See http://pymssql.readthedocs.org/en/latest/intro.html#docker
  Thanks Marc Abramowitz.

- Floating point values are now accepted as Stored Procedure arguments
  (GH-287). Thanks Runzhou Li (Leo) for the report and Bill Adams for the
  implementation.

- Send pymssql version in the appname TDS protocol login record field when the
  application doesn't provide one (GH-354)

Bug fixes
---------

- Fix a couple of very common causes of segmentation faults in presence of
  network a partition between a pymssql-based app and SQL Server (GH-147,
  GH-271) Thanks Marc Abramowitz. See also GH-373.

- Fix failures and inconsistencies in query parameter interpolation when
  UTF-8-encoded literals are present (GH-185). Thanks Bill Adams. Also, GH-291.

- Fix ``login_timeout`` parameter of ``pymssql.connect()`` (GH-318)

- Fixed some cases of ``cursor.rowcont`` having a -1 value after iterating
  over the value returned by pymssql cursor ``fetchmany()`` and ``fetchone()``
  methods (GH-141)

- Remove automatic treatment of string literals passed in queries that start
  with ``'0x'`` as hexadecimal values (GH-286)

- Fix build fatal error when using Cython >= 0.22 (GH-311)

Documentation
-------------

- Add installation instructions. Thanks Marc Abramowitz.

- Document DB-API-mandated exceptions.

- Enhance ``_mssql.MSSQLStoredProcedure.bind()`` docs.

- Enhance description of Azure connections requirements.

Internals
---------

- Add Appveyor hosted CI setup for running tests on Windows (GH-347)

- Travis CI: Use newer, faster, container-based infrastructure. Also, test
  against more than one FreeTDS version.

- Make it possible to build official release files (sdist, wheels) on Travis &
  AppVeyor.

Version 2.1.1 - 2014-11-25 - Ramiro Morales
===========================================

Features
--------

- Custom message handlers (GH-139)

  The DB-Library API includes a callback mechanism so applications can provide
  functions known as *message handlers* that get passed informative messages
  sent by the server which then can be logged, shown to the user, etc.

  ``_mssql`` now allows you to install your own *message handlers* written in
  Python. See the ``_msssql`` examples and reference sections of the
  documentation for more details.

  Thanks Marc Abramowitz.

- Compatibility with Azure

  It is now possible to transparently connect to `SQL Server instances`_
  accessible as part of the Azure_ cloud services.

  .. note:: If you need to connect to Azure make sure you use FreeTDS 0.91 or
            newer.

- Customizable per-connection initialization SQL clauses (both in ``pymssql``
  and ``_mssql``) (GH-97)

  It is now possible to customize the SQL statements sent right after the
  connection is established (e.g. ``'SET ANSI_NULLS ON;'``). Previously
  it was a hard-coded list of queries. See the ``_mssql.MSSQLConnection``
  documentation for more details.

  Thanks Marc Abramowitz.

- Added ability to handle instances of ``uuid.UUID`` passed as parameters for
  SQL queries both in ``pymssql`` and ``_mssql``. (GH-209)

  Thanks Marat Mavlyutov.

- Allow using `SQL Server autocommit mode`_ from ``pymssql`` at connection
  opening time. This allows e.g. DDL statements like ``DROP DATABASE`` to be
  executed. (GH-210)

  Thanks Marat Mavlyutov.

- Documentation: Explicitly mention minimum versions supported of Python (2.6)
  and SQL Server (2005).

- Incremental enhancements to the documentation.

.. _SQL Server instances: http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/services/sql-database/
.. _Azure: https://www.windowsazure.com/
.. _SQL Server autocommit mode: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms187878%28v=sql.105%29.aspx

Bug fixes
---------

- Handle errors when calling Stored Procedures via the ``.callproc()`` pymssql
  cursor method. Now it will raise a DB-API ``DatabaseException``; previously
  it allowed a ``_mssql.MSSQLDatabaseException`` exception to surface.

- Fixes in ``tds_version`` ``_mssql`` connections property value

  Made it work with TDS protocol version 7.2. (GH-211)

  The value returned for TDS version 7.1 is still 8.0 for backward
  compatibility (this is because such feature got added in times when
  Microsoft documentation labeled the two protocol versions that followed 7.0
  as 8.0 and 9.0; later it changed them to 7.1 and 7.2 respectively) and will
  be corrected in a future release (2.2).

- PEP 249 compliance (GH-251)

  Added type constructors to increase compatibility with other libraries.

  Thanks Aymeric Augustin.

- pymssql: Made handling of integer SP params more robust (GH-237)

- Check lower bound value when convering integer values from to Python to SQL
  (GH-238)

Internals
---------

- Completed migration of the test suite from nose to py.test.

- Added a few more test cases to our suite.

- Tests: Modified a couple of test cases so the full suite can be run against
  SQL Server 2005.

- Added testing of successful build of documentation to Travis CI script.

- Build process: Cleanup intermediate and ad-hoc anciliary files (GH-231,
  GH-273)

- setup.py: Fixed handling of release tarballs contents so no extraneous files
  are shipped and the documentation tree is actually included. Also, removed
  unused code.

Version 2.1.0 - 2014-02-25 - `Marc Abramowitz <http://marc-abramowitz.com/>`_
=============================================================================

Features
--------

- Sphinx-based documentation (GH-149)

  Read it online at http://pymssql.org/

- "Green" support (GH-135)

  Lets you use pymssql with cooperative multi-tasking systems like
  gevent and have pymssql call a callback when it is waiting for a
  response from the server. You can set this callback to yield to
  another greenlet, coroutine, etc. For example, for gevent, you could
  do::

      def wait_callback(read_fileno):
          gevent.socket.wait_read(read_fileno)

      pymssql.set_wait_callback(wait_callback)

  The above is useful if you're say, running a gunicorn server with the
  gevent worker. With this callback in place, when you send a query to
  SQL server and are waiting for a response, you can yield to other
  greenlets and process other requests. This is super useful when you
  have high concurrency and/or slow database queries and lets you use
  less gunicorn worker processes and still handle high concurrency.

  See https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/135

- Better error messages.

  E.g.: For a connection failure, instead of:

      pymssql.OperationalError: (20009, 'Net-Lib error during Connection
      refused')

  the dberrstr is also included, resulting in:

      pymssql.OperationalError: (20009, 'DB-Lib error message 20009,
      severity 9:\nUnable to connect: Adaptive Server is unavailable or
      does not exist\nNet-Lib error during Connection refused\n')

  See:
  * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/151

  In the area of error messages, we also made this change:

  execute: Raise ColumnsWithoutNamesError when as_dict=True and missing
  column names (GH-160)

  because the previous behavior was very confusing; instead of raising
  an exception, we would just return row dicts with those columns
  missing. This prompted at least one question on the mailing list
  (https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/pymssql/JoZpmNZFtxM),
  so we thought it was better to handle this explicitly by raising an
  exception, so the user would understand what went wrong.

  See:
  * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/160
  * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/168

- Performance improvements

  You are most likely to notice a difference from these when you are
  fetching a large number of rows.

  * Reworked row fetching (GH-159)

    There was a rather large amount of type conversion occuring when
    fetching a row from pymssql. The number of conversions required have
    been cut down significantly with these changes.
    Thanks Damien, Churchill!

    See:
    * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/158
    * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/159

  * Modify get_row() to use the CPython tuple API (GH-178)

    This drops the previous method of building up a row tuple and switches
    to using the CPython API, which allows you to create a correctly sized
    tuple at the beginning and simply fill it in. This appears to offer
    around a 10% boost when fetching rows from a table where the data is
    already in memory.
    Thanks Damien, Churchill!

    See:
    * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/178

- MSSQLConnection: Add `with` (context manager) support (GH-171)

  This adds `with` statement support for MSSQLConnection in the `_mssql`
  module -- e.g.::

      with mssqlconn() as conn:
          conn.execute_query("SELECT @@version AS version")

  We already have `with` statement support for the `pymssql` module.
  See:

  * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/171

- Allow passing in binary data (GH-179)

  Use the bytesarray type added in Python 2.6 to signify that this is
  binary data and to quote it accordingly. Also modify the handling of
  str/bytes types checking the first 2 characters for b'0x' and insert
  that as binary data.
  See:

  * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/179

- Add support for binding uuid.UUID instances to stored procedures input
  params (GH-143)
  Thanks, Ramiro Morales!

  See:
  * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/143
  * https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/commit/1689c83878304f735eb38b1c63c31e210b028ea7

- The version number is now stored in one place, in pymssql_version.h
  This makes it easier to update the version number and not forget any
  places, like I did with pymssql 2.0.1

  * See https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/commit/fd317df65fa62691c2af377e4661defb721b2699

- Improved support for using py.test as test runner (GH-183)

  * See: https://github.com/pymssql/pymssql/pull/183

- Improved PEP-8 and pylint compliance

Bug Fixes

Fri Feb 24 16:11:00 2006  Andrzej Kukula <akukula@users.sourceforge.net>
	* mssqldbmodule.c: fixed typos in docstrings (thanks Konstantin
	  Veretennicov)

Tue Dec 27 15:14:00 2005  Andrzej Kukula <akukula@users.sourceforge.net>
	* mssqldbmodule.c: bug fixes, improvements and cleanups:
	  + implemented set_login_timeout() and set_query_timeout() functions;
	  + eliminated unnecessary ODBC code
	  + cleaned up exception code and improved exception handling,
		SF bug #1335560
	  + web page now correctly mentions FreeTDS 0.63 as the minimal
		required version
	  + stdmsg() method is now deprecated; all errors are concatenated
		in errmsg()
	  + implemented min_error_severity: all errors at or above that
		level will raise the exception; if the severity is lower, they
		will just accumulate in errmsg()
	  + added setting coltype to NUMBER for float types (found by
		Jakub Labath)
	* setup.py:
	  + reincarnated ntwdblib.dll which turned out to be redistributable
		after all; pymssql includes the latest version that allows
		connecting to SQL 2005; eliminated some stupid notes from the
		web page and will ease set up process for users
	* apitest_mssql.py: new file
	  + provided by Jakub Labath, this file performs some basic DB-API
		compliance tests; it immediately triggered the unicode bug
	* version 0.7.4

Sat Oct 22 19:41:00 2005  Andrzej Kukula <akukula@users.sourceforge.net>
	* mssqldbmodule.c: multithreading improvements - from now on pymssql
	  is thread-safe, it releases GIL in proper places; idea and initial
	  patch by John-Peter Lee (thanks very much!)

Mon Sep 5 23:29:00 2005  Andrzej Kukula <akukula@users.sourceforge.net>
	* setup.py: fixed an installation issue regarding importing pymssql
	  that imports _mssql which isn't installed, and blows up with
	  AttributeError... (thanks Vsevolod Stakhov)
	* version 0.7.3

Mon Sep 5 00:32:00 2005  Andrzej Kukula <akukula@users.sourceforge.net>
	* version 0.7.2

Sun Sep 4 23:12:00 2005  Andrzej Kukula <akukula@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mssqldbmodule.c: improvements and cleanups:
	  + improved error handling: if the db function fails, the exception
		is thrown automatically and immediately; no need to check
		return value of conn.query(), just catch _mssql.error
	  + improved error handling: it is possible that MS SQL calls message
		handler twice; now _mssql catches and reports both of them at once
	  + improved error handling: in some cases _mssql.query() returns
		success but the results are invalid; now it is handled properly
		(example "SELECT CAST(1234.5678 AS NUMERIC(4,2))")
	  + added proper connection initialization: a number of SET statements
		are executed upon connection setup to set sensible SQL behaviour;
		see source for details; one needs to unset them if needed
	  + implemented min_{message|error}_severity as it is in php_mssql
		to ignore unimportant errors; it's work in progress
	  + new function rmv_lcl() initially by Mark Pettit, to strip locale
		crap from MONEY values converted to SQLCHAR while generating
		Decimal object
	  + other small fixes, improvements and janitorial work

Tue Aug 30 00:16:00 2005  Andrzej Kukula <akukula@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mssqldbmodule.c: new features:
	  + large numbers (DECIMAL, NUMERIC, MONEY, SMALLMONEY) are returned
		as Decimal object -- this helps maintain accuracy; thanks to
		Mark Pettit for help
	  + COMPUTE clauses are supported (it wouldn't fetch data for those
		columns before)
	  + ROWID type has been removed from _mssql module
	  + new type DECIMAL to denote Decimal objects in result set

Mon Aug 29 21:59:00 2005  Andrzej Kukula <akukula@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mssqldbmodule.c: some improvements:
	  + BIT values are returned as Python bool objects, suggested by
		Mark Pettit
	  + close() method returns None on success (not to be used at all)
		and throws exception on error
	  + fixed use of uninitialized value when parsing SMALLDATETIME
	  + another round of performance improvements in GetRow() - eliminated
		unnecessary data conversions and unneeded DB-Lib calls
	  + janitorial fixes

Mon Aug 22 04:35:00 2005  Andrzej Kukula <akukula@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mssqldbmodule.c: massive diff:
	  + fixed bug with fetching query results of some data types;
		found by Mark Pettit
	  + fixed IndexError when query returns no rows; patch by Jakub Labath
	  + rewritten function GetRow() that fetches query results: performance
		improvements, better handling of result data types; datetime
		is returned as datetime object instead of string (it's more
		consistent with other values -- and more pythonic :)
	  + eliminated DetermineRowSize()
	  + cleanups: _mssql_init() further improvements w.r.t. Python API
	  + janitorial fixes
	  + added licensing information
	* pymssql.py: docstring changed to look nicer with help()
	* version 0.7.2

Thu Aug 11 02:12:00 2005  Andrzej Kukula <akukula@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mssqldbmodule.c: improved module init function: added doc string,
	  made compliant with Python 2.0+ module interface (there are no more
	  coredumps on help())
	* mssqldbmodule.c: documented that _mssql.connect() is not portable
	  between FreeTDS-dependent platforms and Windows platforms; documented
	  host:port usage

Sat Jul 23 14:20:00 2005  Andrzej Kukula <akukula@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mssqldbmodule.c: eliminated problems with Python exiting upon
	  invalid login credentials with FreeTDS - the culprit was INT_EXIT
	  and FreeTDS setting DBDEAD
	* mssqldbmodule.c: added better error messages (esp. on Windows)
	* mssqldbmodule.c: added msg_handler and err_handler debugging
	* 0.7.1 packages re-released

Fri Jul 22 03:19:00 2005  Andrzej Kukula <akukula@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mssqldbmodule.c: major change; module revamped to support some
	  more builtin Python features; some redundant code removed; memset()
	  removed as there were no benefits but performance decrease
	* mssqldbmodule.c: help(_mssql) works; help for conn object works too
	* pymssql.py: _quote: removed escaping backslash -- with MSSQL it is
	  only needed to escape single quotes by duplicating them
	* pymssql.py: pymssqlCnx class: added a few checks to properly support
	  DB-API 2.0 (see .close() in PEP 249)
	* version 0.7.1

Wed Jul 20 22:12:00 2005  Andrzej Kukula <akukula@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mssqldbmodule.c: removed the workaround for date issue; there were
	  more problems than benefits
	* mssqldbmodule_tds.c: removed
	* some more cleanups and corrections

Tue Jul 19 14:23:00 2005  Andrzej Kukula <akukula@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mssqldbmodule.c: major change; many portability problems fixed

	* mssqldbmodule_tds.c: module to get FreeTDS compile-time settings
	* build fixes; now it builds cleanly on FreeBSD, Linux and Windows
	* version 0.7.0

Mon Jul 18 15:21:00 2005  Andrzej Kukula <akukula@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mssqldbmodule.c: fix build on Windows: changed MS_WIN32 to MS_WINDOWS
	  reported by Mirek Rusin <mirek.rusin@onet.pl>
