Building and developing pymssql
===============================

Building
========

To build pymssql you should have:

* python >= 2.7 including development files. Please research your OS usual
  software distribution channels, e.g, ``python-dev`` or ``python-devel``
  packages.
* Cython >= 0.15
* FreeTDS >= 0.91 including development files. Please research your OS usual
  software distribution channels, e.g, ``freetds-dev`` or ``freetds-devel``
  packages.

.. note::
    If you need to connect to Azure:

    * Use FreeTDS 0.91 or newer
    * Make sure FreeTDS is built with SSL support. Instructions on how to do
      this are out of the scope of this document.

Windows
-------

MinGW
^^^^^

Add to the above requirements:

* MinGW

then you can run::

  python setup.py build -c mingw32

which will build pymssql in the normal python fashion.

MS Visual C++
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Environment Setup:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The commands below should be ran inside a Visual Studio command prompt or a
command prompt window where the ``vcsvars*.bat`` file has been previously run so
it can set the needed environment vars.

Building FreeTDS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Build FreeTDS from the current_ or stable_ tarball.

.. _current: http://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/ALPHA/freetds/current/
.. _stable: http://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/ALPHA/freetds/stable/

Use ``nmake`` (included with VS C++) to build FreeTDS.  To do that,

Define in the environment or on the command line:

1. ``CONFIGURATION`` = ``debug``/``release``
2. ``PLATFORM`` = ``win32``/``x64``

These will determine what is built and where outputs are placed.

Example invocations::

  nmake.exe -f Nmakefile -nologo PLATFORM=win32 CONFIGURATION=debug
  nmake.exe -f Nmakefile -nologo build-win32d

Fixing build errors:  I ran into a couple build errors when using VS 2008, see
the following links for resolutions:

- http://www.freetds.org/userguide/osissues.htm
- http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/freetds/2010q4/026343.html
- http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/freetds/2010q4/026342.html

In src/replacements/getopt.c, you may need to move the section::

  #include "tds_sysdep_private.h"

  #if defined(LIBC_SCCS) && !defined(lint)
  # if 0
    static char sccsid[] = "@(#)getopt.c	8.3 (Berkeley) 4/27/95";
  # else
    __RCSID("$NetBSD: getopt.c,v 1.27 2005/11/29 03:12:00 christos Exp $");
  # endif
  #else
   TDS_RCSID(var, "$Id: getopt.c,v 1.4 2011/05/16 08:16:13 freddy77 Exp $");
  #endif /* LIBC_SCCS and not lint */

to below the lines::

  #if !defined(_WIN32)
  # include <unistd.h>
  #endif

When this is done, the following files should be available (depending on
``CONFIGURATION`` and ``PLATFORM`` used above)::

  src\dblib\<PLATFORM>\<CONFIGURATION>\db-lib.lib
  src\tds\<PLATFORM>\<CONFIGURATION>\tds.lib

for example::

  src\dblib\win32\release\db-lib.lib
  src\tds\win32\release\tds.lib

Those files should then be copied to::

  <pymssql root>\freetds\vs2008_<bitness>\lib\

for example::

  <pymssql root>\freetds\vs2008_32\lib\
  <pymssql root>\freetds\vs2008_64\lib\

The location obviously depends on whether you are performing a 32 or 64 bit
build.

.. note::

  This process is currently only tested with Visual Studio 2008 targeting a
  32-bit build. If you run into problems, please post to the mailing list.

Then you can simply run::

  python setup.py build

or other ``setup.py`` commands as needed.

Unix
----

To build on Unix you must also have:

* gcc

Then you can simply run::

  python setup.py build

or other ``setup.py`` commands as needed.

Testing
=======

.. danger::

  ALL DATA IN TESTING DBS WILL BE DELETED !!!!

You will need to install two additional packages for testing::

  easy_install pytest SQLAlchemy

You should build the package with::

  python setup.py develop

You need to setup a ``tests.cfg`` file in ``tests/`` with the correct DB
connection information for your environment::

  cp tests/tests.cfg.tpl tests/tests.cfg
  vim|emacs|notepad tests/tests.cfg

To run the tests::

  cd tests # optional
  py.test

Which will go through and run all the tests with the settings from the ``DEFAULT``
section of ``tests.cfg``.

To run with a different ``tests.cfg`` section::

  py.test --pymssql-section=<secname>

example::

  py.test --pymssql-section=AllTestsWillRun

to avoid slow tests::

  py.test -m "not slow"

to select specific tests to run::

  py.test tests/test_types.py
  py.test tests/test_types.py tests/test_sprocs.py
  py.test tests/test_types.py::TestTypes
  py.test tests/test_types.py::TestTypes::test_image
